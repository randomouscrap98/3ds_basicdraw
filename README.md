# 3ds_junkdraw
My first foray into 3ds homebrew. Yet another drawing app

## What is it? 
An attempt at a very very poor facsimile of drawpile for local users. And maybe eventually internet users!

It is NOT meant to be super good. I like minimal stuff. For instance, there probably won't be the option to undo strokes.

## Controls

It's in flux; I wouldn't rely on any documentation about controls just yet, even the in-game stuff. Just press some buttons, something will happen! Maybe.

If these work, that's cool:

* **START** : menu
* **SELECT** : change layers
* **L** : color picker
* **A** : pencil tool
* **B** : eraser tool
* **UP/DOWN** : zoom in/out
* **LEFT/RIGHT** : change brush width
* **R+LEFT/RIGHT** : REALLY change brush width
* **R+UP/DOWN** : change page (can have thousands)
* **R+L+UP/DOWN** : REALLY change page (please don't do this)
